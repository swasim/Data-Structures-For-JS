Week 1:

Big-O-Notation
What does O(1) mean (constant time algorithms):
<---algorithm runs constant in time
<---input size does not have an effect on time or performance


What does O(n) mean


What is O(n2)


What is space complexity
<--- the amount of space a given algorithm requires in memory

Data Structures
Build a Heap in Javascript
Build a Binary Search Tree in Javascript
Build a Queue in Javascript
Build a Stack in Javascript
Explain the difference between an array and a Queue.
What is the space complexity for all these data structures

Start Pseudocoding everything


Object Oriented Programming
-Classes
-Polymorphism
⁃	Why is

What is recursion?
ex)   given a string -> console.log every letter inside that string (No for loop)


Once you solve the answers we will work on algorithms using data structures.
We will start whiteboarding
